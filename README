dbutil.h - A utility header that I've been slowly adding to and using
in my projects.

**Current features**

Macros:
- defer( block ): Defer executing a block of code until end-of-scope
- __unused (if undefined): Declare a variable unused
- __initializer: Apply to a function to call it before main
- __packed: To pack structs
- __concat: Concatenate macro's that need expanding

Debugging:
- DEBUG(fmt, ...): your standard debug macro

Timing:
- timespec_diff: Calculate diff between 2 timespecs
- time_block(struct timespec diff, block): Time a block of code, putting the result in diff
- time_scope(start, end, diff): Time the code in the current scope, putting the
  result in diff.

Integer hash table (similar interface to Linux kernel).
